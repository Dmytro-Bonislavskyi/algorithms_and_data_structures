    "The opportunity to work with a binary tree and recursion reminded me of my university days. And it confirmed once again that without constant practice, the skill is lost. \n",

    "and that tree is a complete binary tree. Then, to solve this problem, I came up with the idea of making a helper class that would pass more than one parameter (including a List that would store the current version of the paths). \n",
